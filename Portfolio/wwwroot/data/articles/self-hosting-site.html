  As briefly outlined in the <a href="https://sammatthewsportfolio.xyz/Articles/portfolio_site">original article involving this site</a>, the free Azure hosting solutions are not very good for even personal sites.
  The main issue is to do with the initial loading time of the site, regardless of complexity.
  As a result, I decided to host the site myself which was a somewhat involved but fairly straightforward process.
  Microsoft has <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/linux-nginx?view=aspnetcore-3.1">detailed documentation</a> on this which makes the process easier.

<h2>Hosting</h2>

<p>
  I decided to use <a href="https://www.vultr.com/">Vultur</a> as a hosting provider.
  The reason for this was that I had seen other projects running it before and knew that it would be sufficient for my purposes.
  Also, the pricing is very cheap for how capable it is.
  The other advantage to using a server like this is that I can just manage it like I would any normal Linux system as opposed to using a labyrinthine web client.
  In addition to this, a server like this can easily be configured to host multiple domains at no extra cost on the server end which is great.

<h2>Server</h2>

<p>
  The server is being hosted using <a href="https://www.nginx.com"/>Nginx</a> which is easy to configure and maintain.
  I also wanted an excuse to learn Nginx as I have had some experience with Apache in the past.
  For https support, I chose to use <a href ="https://certbot.eff.org/">Certbot</a> to generate the correct Nginx configuration as well as register the domains correctly.
</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>
  Using a dedicated custom server has certainly paid off in comparison to the free Azure hosting solutions.
  This in terms of cost as well as stability, configurability and performance.

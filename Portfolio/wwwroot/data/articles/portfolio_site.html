	The website you are currently viewing evolved from my effort to learn C# as well as the rest of the Microsoft stack.
	While, I already had some experience with making HTML pages, my experience was more involved with desktop applications, TUI's and robotics.
	Nevertheless, I thought it important to learn these newer technologies due to their prevalence and desirability in the industry.
	Plus, I wanted a better (and more customisable) way to show existing and future works and not just use sites like GitHub.
</p>
<p>
	The source code for the site can be found <a href="https://github.com/Miyukiichan/Portfolio_Site">here</a>.
</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
	I initially started following along with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oW8nviYduHq7bmKode-p8Wy">Official Microsoft tutorial on ASP.NET</a> to get to grips with the fundamentals.
	From there I decided to use the site as a portfolio homepage so that there was more purpose in what was being developed.
	As this is a personal website, the backend for writing articles does not need to be fool proof or extremely fleshed out.
	I did however want an easy way to add new articles without having to rebuild the app or duplicate any html code.
</p>
<p>
	The approach that was taken was to represent articles with JSON and to render html files as strings in the middle of a view along with relevant information.
	This allows the article administrator to simply write the main html content of the article and add it dynamically to the JSON database.
	This also allows for the system to be expanded to use a database such as SQL server with minimal code changes to the front end.
</p>
<h2>Issues</h2>
<p>
	One major setback I had was sending articles to the article view page to be displayed. 
	This was because I didn't know about MVC and how dynamic routing can be used to display different information.
	From there I learned that using the article ID as part of the URL can define what content to display on the page.
</p>
<p>
	Another issue is actually to do with the current hosting solution of the site.
	It is currently hosted on Azure using the free hosting service which is abominably slow.
	In future, I will either switch the hosting plan or research how to host an ASP.NET app on a personal server.

<p>
	The website you are currently viewing evolved from my effort to learn C# as well as the rest of the Microsoft stack.
	While, I already had some experience with making HTML pages, my experience was more involved with desktop applications, TUI's and robotics.
	Nevertheless, I thought it important to learn these newer technologies due to their prevalence and desirability.
	Plus, I wanted a better (and more customisable) way to show existing and future works and not just use sites like GitHub.

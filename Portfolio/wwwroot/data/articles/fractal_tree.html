<p>
  This is a HTML5 and vanilla JS project geared towards fractal tree algorithmic art.
  What started off as an exorcise in JavaScript quickly turned into a full fledged web application with a myriad of configuration options.
  This allows the user to create various interesting symmetrical shapes that are far from tree like in substance and can be extremely pretty.
  The fractal being drawn is a simple binary splitting tree where a branch has two offshoot branches at an angle.
  The source code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/Miyukiichan/Fractal-tree">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>Functionality</h2>

<p>
  The user can create, duplicate and delete trees as well as move them around with the mouse.
  There are also several options that can be changed for each tree independently.
  These make up the bulk of the power behind this system and mainly came about as a means to remove the hard coded values that made up the ideal tree.
  Through complex combinations of these settings, it is easy to generate some unique shapes every time, even when just clicking around randomly.
  The options available are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Angle between the binary split</li>
  <li>Recursion depth (maxed out at 11 for performance reasons)</li>
  <li>Overall size of the tree</li>
  <li>Line colour</li>
  <li>Rotation about the centre point</li>
  <li>Rate of length change (constant multiplier of the length as it continues)</li>
  <li>Width of the line drawn</li>
  <li>Rate of angle change (how much the angle between the splits changes as the recursion continues)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>

<p>
  Through the course of this project, aside from needing to brush up on my trigonometry, I learned various JS techniques as well as how to draw to a HTML5 canvas.
  This was a good introduction to how object orientation in JS works as well as a good exorcise in JS code structure and reusability.
  Many of the functions written for convenience in this project are useful everywhere in JS and will definitely be reused in other projects.

<p>
  I also had some difficulty with the styling of the range input sliders.
  My goal was to update the style dynamically to match the user configurable colour palette but discovered that this would be impossible in the current setup.
  As a result, the controls were styled independently of the configurable colours too for the sake of consistency.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
  Overall, this was a fun and fulfilling endeavour in making an app that is fun to play with (or simply to stare at).
  It also forms the basis of other fractal based projects in the future such as generic L-System art applications for the web.

<p>
  This is a vanilla JavaScript project that was used to learn JS itself and also practice general HTML, CSS and SASS.
  The project is semi-ongoing right now as I need to decide on a way to persistently store the todo lists.
  The code for the project can be found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Miyukiichan/JS-Todo-List">here</a>.

<h2>Approach</h2>

<p>
  The usual way I learn new languages is by following most of a video tutorial and then deviating from and improving upon the system.
  This project was no exception although so far the result is still quite similar to the sample.
  You can find the reference video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttf3CEsEwMQ">here</a> if your interested.
  The main deviations were the way that I managed the CSS using SASS as well as using a more appealing style overall.
  Additionally, I made an effort to make certain aspects of the JS more generic and usable either for the current project or as utilities for the future.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
  This project has been a very good starting point for my JS education and was very enjoyable to work on.
  However, my new goal is to make a project without a detailed guide and hopefully with some more advanced features (possibly using a framework).

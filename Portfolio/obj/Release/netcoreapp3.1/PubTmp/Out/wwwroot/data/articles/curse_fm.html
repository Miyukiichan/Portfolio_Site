    While <a href="https://github.com/ranger/ranger">ranger</a> has amazing features and is the patron saint of TUI file managers, alternatives have been emerging with a greater emphasis on speed and minimalism.
    This is one of those attempts as sort of a pet project and something to do for fun. The project itself can be found <a href="https://github.com/Miyukiichan/CurseFM">here</a>.
</p>
<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>
    My main goal was to imitate and improve upon another ranger alternative called <a href="https://github.com/mananapr/cfiles">cfiles</a>.
    Initially, I wanted to take the existing source code and improve the design of it as well as simplify it a bit more.
    However, I felt that that would take more work than simply starting from scratch.
</p>
<p>
    I wanted to have something that could display directory content, support file previews as well as navigate to and open files.
    I also wanted to have something highly configurable and easily modifiable either in source code or using scripts called from the application.
    Another good thing to have is image previews in the terminal as well as the ability to extend the application easily with user modules.
</p>
<h2>Current Status</h2>
<p>
    At the moment, aside from some bugs, the application performs what I wanted from a minimal file manager and is in a fairly good place.
    I have more ambitious goals laid out on the GitHub page that I may address in the future.

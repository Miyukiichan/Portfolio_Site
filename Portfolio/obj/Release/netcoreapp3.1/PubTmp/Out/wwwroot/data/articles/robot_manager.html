    This was my final year project in university and is all about managing large mobile robots in a safe and convenient way. 
    The software was designed to run run on robots such as <a href="https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/cs/research/ir/robots/idris/">Idris</a> but could run on any Linux system using ROS (Robotics Operating System).
    More information as well as the source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/Miyukiichan/robot_manager">here</a>

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
    One of the main issue when working with these robots was located in the workflow of setting them up, connecting to them and monitoring them remotely.
    This required the use of a laptop as well as a reliable connection to the unit which is not always possible during operation.
    Additionally, Idris already has an onboard screen and keyboard that lets the user interact with a Linux shell.
    However, running several tasks in this environment either requires the need for specialised tools or logging in to TTY sessions several times.
</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>
    The proposed solution to this issue was to create a text based application designed to manage predefined configurable processes as well as control and monitor the robot using ROS.
    This was done in C++ using ncurses.
    The user can select a process to run from a menu which will get its own tab in the tab bar. 
    They can then switch between these tabs to view the output in the main output area of the screen.
    <br><br>
    Interaction can be performed using a keyboard, mouse or touch screen.
    The user can then kill running processes which will terminate in a safe manner.
    There is also the option to control the robot itself and view safety/status information. 
    This is useful when loading the robot for transportation.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    This was possibly the most fun and interesting projects I have ever done.
    It coincided with everything I was interested in at the time.
    It touched on robotics, workflow efficiency and UX, Linux sysadmin as well as TUI interfaces.
    <br><br>
    I was able to learn how to plan effectively as well as change the course of the design per the client's needs in an agile manner.
    Overall, while I think I could have done better in hindsight and with more experience now, the resulting application got the job done and was certainly very useful and unique.
